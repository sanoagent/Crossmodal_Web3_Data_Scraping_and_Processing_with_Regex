# Required Libraries
import gspread
from oauth2client.service_account import ServiceAccountCredentials
# Other libraries will be included as needed, below are placeholders for ease of understanding
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
# Assuming installation and availability of all necessary libraries for scraping, modeling, etc.

# Each part of the notebook will be structured as a combination of markdown explanations and code cells.

## Part 1: KR4DCA - Knowledge Retrieval for Distributed and Crossmodal Agent
# This section focuses on collecting and pre-processing financial data, integrating distributed knowledge retrieval, and handling multimodal scene classification.

### Data Collection and Pre-processing
# Import and integrate relevant functions from regex.ipynb and yahoo_finance_scraper.ipynb

def collect_and_preprocess_data():
    # Placeholder for data collection and preprocessing code
    pass

### Distributed Knowledge Retrieval
# Integrate code from main.py of infernet-node repository here

def distributed_knowledge_retrieval():
    # Placeholder for distributed knowledge retrieval code
    pass

### Multimodal Scene Classification
# Apply scene classification techniques from Scene_Classification.ipynb

def multimodal_scene_classification():
    # Placeholder for multimodal scene classification code
    pass

## Part 2: KD4SER - Knowledge Distillation for Signal Emotion Recognition
# Federated knowledge alignment from FedKA-Digit-Five.ipynb and emotion recognition techniques

def knowledge_distillation_signal_emotion():
    # Placeholder for knowledge distillation for signal emotion recognition
    pass

## Part 3: HoT4FD - Hypergraph of Thought for Fuzzy Distillation
# Building Hypergraph of Thought from medusa_inference_explained.ipynb and applying fuzzy distillation

def hypergraph_of_thought_fuzzy_distillation():
    # Placeholder for HoT construction and fuzzy distillation
    pass

## Part 4: HoT4DP - Hypergraph of Thought for Distillation Pipeline
# Utilizing the constructed Hypergraph of Thought to create a distillation pipeline, integrating raw data from KR4DCA

def hot_distillation_pipeline():
    # Placeholder for HoT distillation pipeline creation and integration
    pass

# Similarly define functions or sections for DP4MoE, MoE4XP, ZK4CFM, and UP4DCA based on the directives provided.

## Part 5: UP4DCA - Unified Pipeline for Distributed and Crossmodal Agent
# Final integration, leveraging gspread for working with Google Sheets

def unified_pipeline_integration():
    # Setup Google Sheets client
    scope = ["https://spreadsheets.google.com/feeds",'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets',"https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file","https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive"]
    creds = ServiceAccountCredentials.from_json_keyfile_name('your_credentials_file.json', scope)
    client = gspread.authorize(creds)

    # Assuming a function definition for processing distributed unified insights
    process_distributed_unified_insights(client)

def process_distributed_unified_insights(client):
    # Placeholder for processing insights and updating Google Sheets
    pass

# Note: Ensure to replace placeholders with actual code integrating the functionalities from provided resources.
